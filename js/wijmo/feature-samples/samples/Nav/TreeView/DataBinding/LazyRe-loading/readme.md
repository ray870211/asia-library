Re-loading Lazy-Loaded Nodes
============================

By default, lazy-loaded [TreeView](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_nav.treeview.html) nodes load their data only once, when the node is expanded for the first time. This sample shows how you can change that behavior for selected nodes causing them to re-load their data whenever they are expanded.
