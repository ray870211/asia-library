Accordion Trees
===============

Accordions are multi-pane panels that keep only one panel expanded at a time. They are commonly used for navigation. You can use the [TreeView](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_nav.treeview.html) control to implement accordions. This sample creates an Accordion using the TreeView and CSS by customizing the header display, hiding glyphs and setting [autoCollapse](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_nav.treeview.html#autocollapse) property to true.
