Showing vs. Selecting Nodes
===========================

The [TreeNode](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_nav.treenode.html) class has an [ensureVisible](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_nav.treenode.html#ensurevisible) method that ensures the node is visible by expanding parent nodes as needed and scrolling the node into view if necessary. It also has a [select](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_nav.treenode.html#select) method that shows the node and selects it. This sample demonstrates the difference between selecting and showing nodes.
