Detached Panels
===============

The [TabPanel](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_nav.tabpanel.html) has a built-in panel that shows the content of the selected tab. In some cases, you may want to display the content in a different element. This sample demonstrates hiding the build-in panel and displaying other content when the selection changes (using the [selectedIndexChanged](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_nav.tabpanel.html#selectedindexchanged) event).
