TabPanel Right to Left
======================

HTML accommodates RTL with the '_dir_' attribute.
Setting '_dir_' to '_rtl_' on any element causes the element's content to flow from right to left.

The [TabPanel](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_nav.tabpanel.html) also supports this.
Check the markup in the sample below to see how the attribute is applied to the [TabPanel](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_nav.tabpanel.html).
