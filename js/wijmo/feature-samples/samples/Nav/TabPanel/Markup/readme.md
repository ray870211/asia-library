TabPanel Markup
===============

The markup used to initialize [TabPanel](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_nav.tabpanel.html) controls consists of one element per tab, each with two children: the tab header and the tab content. Tab headers are typically links or ``<a>`` tags, and content is wrapped in ``<div>``. View the markup structure of the sample below.
