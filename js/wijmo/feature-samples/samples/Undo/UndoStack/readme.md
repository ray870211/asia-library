UndoStack
=========

The [UndoStack](https://www.grapecity.com/wijmo/api/classes/wijmo_undo.undostack.html) class lets you add and undo/redo stack to a page, a form, or any element.

It tracks changes to regular HTML input elements as well as most Wijmo controls, handles the undo/redo keys automatically, and provides commands for executing undo and redo actions programmatically.
