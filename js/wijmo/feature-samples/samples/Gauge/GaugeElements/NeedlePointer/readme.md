Radial Gauges with Needle Pointers
==================================

By default, Wijmo's radial gauges use a colored sector and a text element to 
indicate the gauge's current value. This results in a clean and easy-to read look.

If you prefer a more traditional needle-style pointer, use the **needleShape** 
and **needleLength** properties to select a needle pointer which can be styled
with CSS.

You can also use the **needleElement** property to use custom SVG elements as
needles, and **createNeedleElement** method to create custom needle shapes.
